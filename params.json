{"name":"Zedboard Audio Interface","tagline":"An Audio Interface for the Zedboard","body":"### Overview\r\nThis interface connects the ADAU1761 audio codec on the Zedboard to the Zynq PL. Audio signals can be received in stereo from the line in jack and/or transmitted to the headphone out jack. The design has originally been developed by Mike Field (alias hamster). In his design it is part of a system for filtering audio signals with the Zedboard (http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/Zedboard_Audio). We have extracted, modified and extended the audio interface part to provide an easy to use standalone IP core for using the audio capabilities on the Zedboard.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* ready to use, standalone IP block\r\n* interface synchronized to 100 MHz system clock\r\n* compatible to Vivado\r\n* testbench to test line in and headphone out\r\n* documentation and \"how-to-use\" guidance\r\n* ready-to-use bitstreams for quick evaluation\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMicroelectronic Systems Design Research Group, TU Kaiserslautern, Germany, http://ems.eit.uni-kl.de/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
